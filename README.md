  ## Installation
  Initiate a clone or pull of a project's repo onto your local machine, then change directory into the README Generator. You will need to run [npm i] to install Inquirer.

  ## Usage
  Type into the terminal command line: 'node index' and it will initiate the program to collect information on the project via the terminal. Once your questions are answered, a README.md file will appear in the root directory that can be relocated into your specific project's root folder and pushed through an update to GitHub via the cloned or pulled local project you previously set up.
